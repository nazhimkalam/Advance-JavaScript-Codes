AJAX is a developer's dream, because you can:

Read data from a web server - after the page has loaded
Update a web page without reloading the page
Send data to a web server - in the background

What is AJAX?
AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript And XML.

AJAX is not a programming language.

AJAX just uses a combination of:

A browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object (to request data from a web server)
JavaScript and HTML DOM (to display or use the data)

the web page and the XML file it tries to load, must be located on the same server.
the XML files you load must be located on your own server.
