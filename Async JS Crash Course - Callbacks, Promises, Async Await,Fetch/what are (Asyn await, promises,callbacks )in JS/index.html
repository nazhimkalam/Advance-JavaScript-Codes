      * We can write promises in a shorter way using (async await), than using
      multiple then in the normal promises.

      * A callback function is a function passed into another function as an
      argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some
      kind of routine or action
      <br />
      <br />
      * Promises are used to handle asynchronous
      operations in JavaScript. They are easy to manage when dealing with
      multiple asynchronous operations where callbacks can create callback hell
      leading to unmanageable code
      <br />
      <br />
      * When you create a Promise, you pass in a callback function as an
      argument. Inside the function, you pass in two arguments: resolve and
      reject . When the Promise's should be considered completed, run the
      resolve() method. You can pass in arguments that should get passed into
